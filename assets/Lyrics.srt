1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:14,760
Oh, hey

2
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:18,066
You don't know, babe

3
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,955
When you hold me

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,177
And kiss me slowly

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,466
It's the sweetest thing

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,666
And it don't change

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,066
If I had it my way

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,822
You would know that you are

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,088
You're the coffee that I need in the morning

10
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,000
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,466
Won't you give yourself to me? Give it all, oh

12
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,200
I just wanna see

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,600
I just wanna see how beautiful you are

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,400
You know that I see it, I know you're a star

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,300
Where you go, I'll follow, no matter how far

16
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:19,300
If life is a movie, know you're the best part

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,500
oh-ooh

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,900
You're the best part

19
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,400
oh-ooh

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,800
Best part

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,900
It's this sunrise

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,300
And those brown eyes, yes

23
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,100
You're the one that I desire

24
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,500
When we wake up

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,300
And then we make love (Make love)

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,300
It makes me feel so nice

27
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,800
You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,800
You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,200
You're the sunshine on my life

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,500
I just wanna see how beautiful you are

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,000
You know that I see it, I know you're a star

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,300
Where you go, I'll follow, no matter how far

33
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:36,300
If life is a movie, then you're the best part

34
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:46,700
You're the best part, ooh

35
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,900
Best part

36
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,500
If you love me, won't you say something? 

37
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,200
If you love me, won't you? Won't you?

38
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,000
If you love me, won't you say something?

39
